<h2>This is meant to be a program that serves two purposes.</h2>

Help me learn java and help me see how many games it will take to level a League of legends account to level 30.
I have been working on this for a while and finally decided to upload it to GitHub because I find it to be in a usable state.

<h2>TODO</h2>

>Fix the math for how xp is calculated

>Refactor Code

>If possible remove gitignore from future commits

>Check to see if using xp boost
